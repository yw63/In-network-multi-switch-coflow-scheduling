# In-network-multi-switch-coflow-scheduling
## Abstract
Datacenter networks play a pivotal role in todayâ€™s digital landscape, and the efficient schedul-
ing of coflows is critical to ensuring optimal performance. Coflow scheduling aims to manage
data flows that share a common application-level goal. However, existing approaches often
face challenges related to performance, accuracy, and scalability. In this thesis, we present
the In-Network Multi-Switch Coflow Scheduling system, addressing challenges in datacenter
networks. Our approach extends real-time coflow classification across switches, fostering dis-
tributed cooperation. This system efficiently enhances performance, scalability, and application
efficiency in datacenter networks.
